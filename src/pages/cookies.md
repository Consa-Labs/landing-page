# Consa Cookie Policy

This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) describes the cookies and other technologies that Consa (Trading name for Atto Digital Limited”) uses on its website and mobile application (the “Site”) and the choices that you have. This Cookie Policy forms part of our Privacy Policy.
If you are based in the European Economic Area, when you first visit the Site, you will be asked to consent to the use of cookies and other technologies on the Site in accordance with this Cookie Policy, and if you accept we will store them on your computer.

## Cookies and other technologies

A cookie is a piece of information sent to your browser from a website and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Cookies can help a website like ours recognize repeat users and allow a website to track web usage behavior. Cookies work by assigning a number to the user that has no meaning outside of the assigning website.

Cookies can be stored on your computer for different periods of time. “Session cookies” only last for as long as the browser session and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. “Persistent cookies” cookies survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration date set in the cookie (as determined by the third party placing it), and help recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again. The Site uses first party cookies (cookies set directly by Consa) as well as third-party cookies, as described below.

We also use pixel tags (usually in combination with cookies), from the third parties described below, to get information about your usage of the Site and the Services and your interaction with email or other communications. Pixel tags are a technology similar to cookies that can be embedded in online content or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites (for example, to know when content has been shown to you), or to know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message.
